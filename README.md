## DESCRIPTION 

In this project i've mainly focused on FOUR aspects i.e 1) Using open weather API to fetch data ,2) Using pandas to store data in tabular format , 3) Using matplotlib module to create visualizations 4) using streamlit library to create a web based dashboard. Following is more detailed info of my project .
Firstly i have signed into openweather api to get the api key and then i read the documentation to know the parameters to pass while requesting for data.Using get function from requests module i got the weather data from openweather api .Here i have passed the parameters in the form of dictionary .The data returned is  in json format .online json viewer helped me understand the data easily and to acces them effectively .so i have taken the required information to create visualization into a list so that i can convert that list into a dataframe using pandas library.Now that the data is structured into list i simply made a dataframe using pandas. Now using matplotlib.pyplot module i made visualizations (line plot and bar plot).Most of the functions in creating visulaizations are similar which made it easy to create them. title function is used to give a name to the plot ,xlabel function gives name to x-axis and ylabel to y-axis,show is used to display . Now finally i used streamlit module to create a web based dashboard .The dashboard displays:1)The raw weather data in a tabular format.2)The temperature line plot. 3)The humidity bar plot.I've taken help of online sources for this as i,m new to this module . But it feels productive to know new things.Streamlitâ€™s simplicity and flexibility made it easy to create a professionallooking dashboard . For example, I used st.title() to add a title to the dashboard and st.subheader() to organize sections. Although I was new to Streamlit, I found plenty of online resources and documentation to guide me through the process.I learnt working with API"s understood how to structure requests(online json viewer helped me with this) , I learnt how to create better and meaningfull visualisations using matplotlib .And This was my first experience with Streamlit, and I found it to be a powerful tool for quickly building web based dashboards.
ThankYou For Reading
